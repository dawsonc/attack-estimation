    "Humans are notoriously bad at reasoning about probabilities: more often than not, we rely on cognitive shortcuts (heuristics and biases) instead of actually calculating the liklihood of events. This can be a good thing; just think how paralyzed we would be if we stopped to calculate the probability of rain every time we heard raindrops on our window, rather than just grabbing an umbrella! Even computers can start to run into tractability problems when working with probability distributions involving even a few dozen variables. In this tutorial, we will introduce a tool, called Bayesian networks, for automatically and efficiently reasoning about probabilities. These networks will allow us to ask questions like \"given this new evidence, what is the probability of some hidden variable being true\" or \"what is the most likely explanation for some set of observations?\". These questions might remind you of our lectures on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); it turns out that Bayesian networks can be used to represent Markov processes, but they are much more expressive and can be used to model much more complicated scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this discussion more concrete, it's helpful to have a motivating example. You are a security engineer in the employ of the Generic Galactic Empire aboard a controversial new ~~moon~~ space station. You are aware of several security vulnerabilities in the space station's software subsystems, but you have no way to detect whether those vulnerabilities are being exploited except by running diagnostics on various workstations throughout the station. Since you'd like to be able to detect attacks based on the probability that a vulnerability is being exploited, you'd like an easy way to relate your observations of workstations to the probability of a cyberattack taking place. After a brief review of probability fundamentals, we'll discuss how Bayesian networks can be used to model this situation and make inferences automatically.\n",

    "## Probability Review\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will provide a quick review of relevant probability concepts. For a more thorough review, see Russel & Norvig AIMA, Chapter 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of $n$ discrete random variables, we can fully represent the probabilities and relationships between all $n$ variables using a table called the **joint distribution**. This table has a dimension for every variable and a row for each possible assignment to that variable; a joint distribution for 2 binary variables, $A$ and $B$, would have a row for each value of $A$ and a column for each value of $B$. Each entry in the joint distribution contains the probability that the corresponding assignment to each of the variables will be observed; in the $2\\times2$ case, the $(0, 0)$ entry would contain the probability that $A=0$ and $B=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the joint distribution allows us to lookup probabilities $P(A\\land B \\land C \\land ...)$ just be reading the value out of the joint distribution table. They also allow us to find the so-called *marginal probability* of some variable $P(A)$, which is the probability that $A$ takes on some value regardless of the value of all other variables. In the binary case, $P(A) = P(A\\land B) + P(A \\land \\text{not }B)$; in the general case, we can calculate the marginal probability by summing over all possible values of the variables we don't care about (this is called **marginalizing** out those summed variable), like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\sum_{\\text{all possible assignments to }B,C,\\ldots} P(A \\land B \\land C \\land \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we are interested in the case when we have observed some variable assignments (which we call the evidence variables $e$), and we are interested in the probability of some other variables ($X$) given those observations. This probability $P(X | e)$ is called the **conditional** or **posterior probability**, and it can be calculated using the product rule, $P(A\\land e) = P(X|e) P(e)$, which we can rearrange to find \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X | e) = P(X\\land e)/P(e) = \\alpha P(X \\land e)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a normalization factor calculated so that $P(X | e) + P(\\text{not }X | e) = 1$. Note that $P(X \\land e)$ is simply a marginal probability, so we can compute it from the joint distribution by marginalizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X\\land e) = \\sum_{\\text{all possible assignments to }y\\text{ not in}x, e}P(X \\land e \\land y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these equations, we can answer whatever queries we want just by looking up entries in the corresponding joint distribution table. This would be nice, but unfortunately these joint distributions are often too large to use in practice. Even for relatively simple binary variables, the size of the table grows exponentially, $O(2^n)$, where $n$ is the number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this exponential growth, we can apply some common sense. Let's say we want to calculate the probability that three sequential fair coin tosses both come out heads. We could create a joint distribution table for the two variables ($H1$ for whether the first coin comes out heads, and so on for $H2$ and $H3$). This joint table would have $2^3=8$ entries. However, we know that the outcome of the first coin toss does not influence the outcome of later tosses. Formally, we know that $P(H3 | H1, H2) = P(H3)$, and similarly for $P(H1 | H2, H3) = P(H1)$ and $P(H2 | H1, H3) = P(H2)$. Because these variables are **independent**, we only need to specify a distribution for each set of independent variables. In this case, we would need three **conditional distributions**, each with 2 entries (6 total entries, saving 2 compared to the full joint distribution, but these savings grow exponentially). In general, if we have multiple sets of variables, where the variables in each set are independent from variables in other sets, we need one conditional distribution per set. Intuitively, if the joint distribution needs $2^n$ storage, two conditional distributions would only need $2^{n/2}+2^{n/2} \\ll 2^n$. By encoding our common-sense knowledge (e.g. of causality and independence), we can make probabilistic inference much more easily than over the full joint distribution.\n",

    "Exploiting conditional independence can allow us to reason much more efficiently about joint probabilities, but it would be really nice if we could automate the inference process by encoding conditional probabilities in a convenient data structure. Since dependence relates each variable to a set of \"parent\" variables, a natural structure is a directed graph, where\n",
    "- Each node corresponds to an uncertain variable (in this tutorial, we'll restrict ourselves to discrete random variables),\n",
    "- If variable $B$ is dependent on $A$, then we draw a directed edge from node `A` to node `B` in the graph, and\n",
    "- Each node $X$ is labelled with its conditional probability distribution $P(X\\ |\\ \\text{Parents}(X))$, which takes the form of a table with a row for each combination of assignments to the parent variables of $X$, specifying the probabilities that $X$ takes on each of its values conditioned on those parent variable assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't want any variable to depend (directly or indirectly) on itself, this graph must not have any directed cycles (making it a *directed acyclic graph*. An example graph is shown in the figure below. Given this structure, we can see that it directly encodes both independence and conditional independence: sibling nodes (i.e. nodes sharing a parent) are conditionally independent, while nodes in disconnected graphs are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this data structure a Bayesian network (or sometimes a *belief network* or *causal network*). These networks can represent any full joint distribution, but depending on the degree to which causal relationships allow us to factor the joint distribution into smaller conditional distributions, Bayesian networks can encode this information much more compactly. In the next example, we'll give a simple example of a Bayesian network and show how we can make inference based on these networks."

    "### A simple example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to the more complicated case of our original motivating problem, we'll use the simpler scenario from Fig. 14.2 in Russel & Norvig to illustrate the key features of Bayesian networks. In this scenario, you've just installed a new alarm in your house, and since you don't want Google spying on your home, you've chosen not to connect the alarm to the internet. Instead, you've asked your neighbors, John and Mary, to listen for the alarm and call you if they hear it going off. Complicating matters, the alarm will go off if a burglary occurs, but it is a little too sensitive and will also go off if an earthquake occurs. In addition, John will will sometimes confuse a telephone ringing for the alarm and call then as well, and because Mary likes listening to loud music, she will sometimes miss the alarm altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we essentially have five uncertain boolean variables:\n",
    "+ `B`: whether a burglary has occurred,\n",
    "+ `E`: whether an earthquake has occurred,\n",
    "+ `A`: whether the alarm has gone off,\n",
    "+ `J`: whether John calls you, and\n",
    "+ `M`: whether Mary calls you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that only `J` and `M` are observable. If we were to encode the full joint probability distribution, we'd need to store a table of size $O(2^n) = O(32)$. This is not too large in thi scase, but if you have even 30 variables then the joint distribution table would require $O(4$ GB$)$ of storage, and adding a 31st variable would require another 4 GB! We are clearly on the wrong side of this exponential when it comes to the joint distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the problem more tractable, we can exploit the causal relationships between these variables, allowing us to store a handful of smaller conditional distributions rather than a monolithic joint distribution. The causal structure of this problem leads to the Bayesian network shown in the image below (reprinted from Russell & Norvig):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/figs/alarm-problem-structure.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `J` and `M` only depend on `A`, we don't need to explicitly store the effect of an earthquake on the probability of John calling. Instead of a 32-entry joint distribution, we only need to store 20 values in 5 smaller conditional distributions. Only 10 entries are shown here because for boolean variables the probability of a false value is fixed at 1-(the probability of a true value). For scenarios with even more variables, these savings would be even more dramatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Bayesian network representation is not unique: you can order the variables in any way you want and back out the conditional probability tables from the joint distribution. In this case, we have ordered the nodes from causes to effects (causes at the top, flowing down to effects at the bottom of the network). This is a good heuristic for constructing concise Bayesian networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've written classes in `bayes_net.py` implementing the basic functionality of Bayesian networks for you, allowing you to represent these networks programmatically. You should go check out the source code to get an idea of what features are available, and a basic example of constructing a network for this example scenario is given below. To properly load the drawing function, **you must run this cell twice**."

    "\n",
    "So far in this notebook, we've stuck with relatively small nets and simple distributions. That means that doing exact inference - calculating analytically exactly what some distribution will look like - is possible. For a lot of problems that we care about, though, exact inference isn't possible. There are lots of reasons this might happen: some distribution is wonky and therefore can't be reasoned about analytically, a net is so complex that doing all the math to marginalize out variables seems impossible, etc.\n",

    "One of the simplest approximate inference algorithms is called rejection sampling. The basic idea is to generate samples from the joint distribution (so, sample all the variables), and then reject any samples that don't match the evidence. By keeping track of the samples that do match the evidence, you can slowly generate examples of what the net looks like when fitting the evidence. In other words, you get a distribution over the joint, conditioned on the evidence, which is exactly what you want.\n",

    "\n",

    "Now that we have a handle on rejection sampling, let's see if we can use some of the same ideas (sampling instead of exact calculations) without paying the cost of a huge number of samples that we discard.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gibbs sampling, the basic idea is to form a Markov Chain (MC) over the joint states. In one timestep, the MC will have a full assignment. In the next, exactly one of the variables in the net will be randomly sampled, conditioned on its Markov blanket. That means that either zero or one variables changes at each timestep.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out (and AIMA explains the theory in far more depth), that if you run an MC like this for a long time, assuming some nice properties of the Bayes Net, the distribution of joint states visited in the MC exactly matches the joint distribution of the net. Furthermore, conditioning on variables being assigned to specific values becomes extremely easy: when transitioning to the next state in the MC, never change the evidence variables from their assigned values. That means that every single state the MC visits will match the evidence, neatly fixing the issue with rejection sampling's inefficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Gibbs sampling isn't just a pure win. How one intializes all the variables to start of the MC can matter, at least in the short term. Imagine if the net were initialized to some extremely unlikely configuration and the MC were only run for a short time. The empirical distribution would likely not reflect the true distribution. The good news is that, over time, the effects of the initialization should wear off. That's why many researchers use what's called a \"burn in\" period - some number of samples where you run the MC after initialization but without recording any of the data. How long is long enough for burn in? That's an open research question."
